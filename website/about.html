							<p>I am Jonas, the founder and one of the people behind <span class="strong">Stackademy</span>.</p>
							<p>With <span class="strong">Stackademy</span>, we're bringing the intense, full-time programming course to Berlin that we ourselves would want to take part in: 
							<br />Rather than working through countless online courses with varying degrees of success, only to find out you don't 
							end up where you intended to go, <span class="strong">Stackademy</span> offers you the chance to dedicate 12 weeks to learn full-time how to plan, develop and deploy web applications in the conducive environment you're looking for. <br />
							All that in Europe's most dynamic startup hub Berlin, where you will learn both about starting a business and working successfully in a growing tech startup.</p>
							<p>Once you finish the course, you are ready to take your new knowledge to the next level by hashing out your own ideas, 
							starting to work on projects or moving into a tech-focused position within in a company or startup - in short: <span class="underline">you will have become a builder</span>.</p>
							<p class="strong">If that is for you, then join us for the ride and <a href="apply.html">apply</a>.</p>
							<p class="smaller">Curious to get the full story? <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('story')">Read on.</a></p>
						</div>	
						
						<div id="story" class="text jus">
							<p>I don't know about you, but it didn't take Marc Andreessen's proclamation that <a href="http://pastebin.com/MbFGXg1r" target="_blank">"software is eating the world"</a> for me to get interested in the power of code. In fact, if computer science classes
							 in my high school had been more accessible, I might have gotten started a lot earlier.</p>
							<p>Chances are, though, that your experience is similar to mine: At school, it's the ten nerds of the year group who take computer science, with all of them knowing more than the teacher already. <br />So unless you stumble into self-teaching early on or 
							decide to study a multi-year computer science course at university, you're left with picking from dozens of online courses or joining twice-a-week evening classes, maybe even about PHP, as your options for learning to program.</p> 
							<p>When I quit my job to dedicate a larger chunk of time to teaching myself to code, I did go for the online course option and was mostly frustrated by seeing how little of what I was learning ever stuck. And course projects like calculator applications and Guess-the-number games didn't help, either.</p>

							<p><br />However, I did manage to get deep enough into HTML and CSS to be able to put webpages together, and I had heard about programming courses taking off in the U.S. that were actually made from the ground up to teach modern web application development. <br />
							With my own experience far from ideal, this course model actually made a lot of sense to me - you can probably recall a rewarding learning experience that came only through dedication and will power.</p>
							<p>Having lived in Berlin for four years by this point, I was lucky enough to have met the right people to contact and question about the potential and ideal setup for such a course, and teamed up with Daniel, who I knew from university, to make Stackademy a reality. 
							With support lined up beyond the course, we progressed to bring exciting guest lectures on board and get sound advice regarding our curriculum. </p>
							<p>Now it's time to get real and have a great first course in one of Europe's leading startup cities. I look forward to seeing you here!</p>

						<p>Our Lead Instructor for the inaugural Web Application Development course is Berlin-based <span class="strong">Matt Patterson</span>. Matt's background is in both design and web development, allowing 
						us to go from the fundamentals all the way to the development and deployment of web applications under his guidance. <br />
						Not only does he work on real world projects as a developer every day, he is also an active teacher as mentor for <a href="http://railsgirls.com/" target="_blank">Rails Girls Berlin</a> and instructor for Ruby on Rails courses.</p>

						<p>Matt honed his coding skills as a senior software engineer with the <span class="strong">BBC's Audio &amp; Music Interactive</span> team out of London, UK, working on a number of projects in Ruby on Rails.</p>
						<p>As of 2007, he is based in Berlin with his own software development consultancy <span class="strong">Constituent Parts</span>. Matt's past projects range from work as one of the founding developers of the UK's <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Government Digital Service</a> all the way to critically-acclaimed video games.
						He is also involved in numerous Berlin user groups and was most recently a co-organizer of the <a href="http://www.uikonf.com/" target="_blank">Berlin UIKonf</a>. Follow him on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/fidothe" title="Intype" target="_blank">@fidothe</a>.</p>

					<div id="berlin" class="text jus">	
						<p><span class="strong">Berlin</span> has found itself as a dynamic and growing startup hub, open to international founders and companies setting up shop here.<br /> 
						If you haven't been, you will find Berlin a great place to be. From fashion and music to arts, the maker community and the obligatory third-wave coffee culture, Berlin is a city full of experimentation and creativity. And while we don't want you to lose focus, Berlin does have great clubs, bars, and events to unwind.</p>
						<p>It is also the right place to get involved with startups: not only are major companies like Google, Amazon, Twitter and Microsoft present in Berlin, it is also home to startups such as <a href="https://readmill.com/" target="_blank">Readmill</a>, 
						<a href="http://eyeem.com/" target="_blank">Eyeem</a>, <a href="http://researchgate.net/" target="_blank">ResearchGate</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> and <a href="https://wooga.com/" target="_blank">Wooga</a>, who are paving the way for more to come. <br /> Which puts you in good company if you decide to follow <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/04/berlins-network-effect-will-make-it-a-global-startup-center/" target="_blank">Matt Cohler's advice</a> : "If for some reason you don't want to (or can't) come to 
						San Francisco, then head to Berlin. All of the key ingredients are there. These are still the early days, and it's good to be in on the ground floor."</p>
